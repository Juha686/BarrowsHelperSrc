# Minimal Alt1/webpack/typescript example

How to use

Download the repository from this page (green code button and download Zip), extract then add this folder somewhere locally on your machine.
You can call this folder whatever you want.

Got to alt1 toolkit, and open it's inbuilt browser.

Navigate to the folder you just saved in the alt1 browsers address bar - then the Dist folder within, then index.html. 
(e.g,C:\Users\marks\Documents\BarrowsHelper\dist\index.html)

The barrows helper shoudl load, and there should be an "Add app" button in the top left, click this to add to your list of alt1 applications. 

The local files must remain on your pc for this to work, as I'm poor and cant afford webhosting, sorry.

From then on the app shoudl behave like any other alt1 app.
